/**
 * October, 2012:
 * This seems to be an ever changing design, so I'm including the date this
 * time.
 * <p>
 * The key value stores are where ODKTables-specific properties are kept about
 * the tables. In general this is things like "displayName" and eventually
 * view settings that do NOT affect the definition of a table.
 * <p>
 * The columns in the KVS are as follows:
 * tableId,
 * partition,
 * aspect,
 * key,
 * type,
 * value
 * <p>
 * These columns intend to restrict the scope of a key and to prevent collision
 * of keys. The primary key is essentially a composite of tableId, partition,
 * aspect, and key.
 * <p>
 * The tableId is the id of the table to which the key
 * applies.
 * <p>
 * The partition defines roughly to whom the key is relevant. A key that
 * matters to the Table as a whole (eg display name) is given the partition
 * "Table". A key that matters only to a column (eg display name of that
 * column) will be given the partition "Column". Additional partitions will be
 * generated as new classes are created that need to store information in the
 * KVS. For instance, "ListView" and "CollectUtil" would be the partitions that
 * store data for the ListView and CollectUtil classes, respectively.
 * Generally, with the exceptions of Table and Column, a rule of thumb is that
 * partitions should be class names for clarity.
 * <p>
 * The aspect is roughly equivalent to a particular instance of a partition. In
 * another sense, it refers to which specific view, or aspect, of the data the
 * key is associated with.
 * In many cases this will simply be "default". The display name of the table
 * would exist in partition=Table, aspect=default. A column's aspect would be
 * the element_key of the column. The element_key is fixed, and with the table
 * id forms a composite key for the column. The display name of a column with
 * the element key "weight" would exist in partition=Column, aspect=weight.
 * The aspect of a particular list view or graph is the name of that view. At
 * the moment (Dec, 2012) we are not allowing named list views or graph views.
 * Currently, therefore, the aspect for these views is assigned "default". A
 * font size in the list view (if such a property was able to be set) would
 * exist in partition=ListView, aspect=default, key=fontSize. If a graph view
 * was named
 * Fridge Count, the x axis would exist in partition=GraphView,
 * aspect=Fridge Count, key=xAxis. (In this example both the name of graph view
 * and the key xAxis were manufactured and do not reflect the true state of
 * the code. Further, it remains to be seen if we'll actually want to allow
 * spaces.)
 * <p>
 * Key is the key assigned to a particular property and must be unique within
 * a partition and aspect.
 * <p>
 * Type is the type of the value. The value field is set as a string, and this
 * type column allows appropriate interpretation of the string residing in
 * value. Obvious types are text, integer, double, and boolean. The complete
 * list of types is reflected in {@link KeyValueStoreEntryType}. For now, the
 * entry object itself comes from aggregate as a JAR. It is essentially just a
 * struct.
 * <p>
 * Value is the actual value of the key. A key specifying font size might have
 * a value of 12. A key specifying display name might have a value of
 * "Admin Areas". The class using the key must know how to interpret the value.
 * <p>
 * Taken in sum, the entry for a table's display name might be as follows:
 * tableId=myUUID, partition=Table, aspect=default, key=displayName, type=text,
 * value=My Custom Name.
 * <p>
 * The font size of the font size in a list view (which is currently not
 * nameable) might be:
 * tableId=myUUID, partition=ListView, aspect=default, key=fontSize,
 * type=integer, value=12.
 * <p>
 * The x axis of a graph view named Fridge Count (although graph views are
 * not currently nameable) might be (assuming that GraphView.java is the class
 * responsible for managing graph views):
 * tableId=myUUID, partition=GraphView, aspect=Fridge Count, key=xAxis,
 * type=text, value=count.
 * <p>
 * There are three of these key value stores, and they hold information about
 * the tables in different states. The three are the active, default, and
 * server key value stores.
 * <p>
 * The active holds the currently displaying version of the tables, which the
 * user modifies when they make changes. The server holds the version that was
 * pulled down from the server. This is also the key value store that is the
 * source of the table properties at the first sync. After that point, we are
 * currently not allowing definition changes to be pushed.
 * (Well, technically you can do
 * it, but in our model we are planning to make this a privileged operation, as
 * there are some very important considerations that the values in the key
 * value stores can have for the actual structure of a table.)
 * <p>
 * The default is a kind of combination between the two. Changes from the
 * server before the last sync will have to be merged from the server table
 * into the default table. Exactly how this happens is at the moment undefined.
 * Suffice it to say that it is a mixture of the two, and more closely tied
 * to active than is the server.
 * <p>
 * active<--default<--MERGE--server
 * active-->default-->server
 * The exact transitions here are up in the air as to when they can happen.
 * <p>
 * There is a fourth key value store. This handles only sync properties. It is
 * called the keyValueStoreSync, and it handles only things like "setToSync",
 * whether or not the table should be synched.
